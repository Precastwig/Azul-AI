## Azul - Summer Pavillion, AI project
This is an implementation of the board game Azul: Summer Pavillion. The aim is to create an AI (or several) that can play the game to a high standard.

# Why C++
I like the language, and creating AI in C++ sounds like a strange challenge, so that's what I'm trying.

# Why Azul
I like the board game, it is pretty complex and has several different obvious "strategies", I've heard people claim certain strategies are the best, So i'd like to refute or prove that somehow.

# Current state of the project
So far it's a simulation that two random decision AI's play (or try to). I'm going to get it fully playable by a player through the command line before I start the proper AI implementation or a nice looking UI. Hopefully that wont take too long.
